This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook showcasing my analysis and calculations on the trend of Childbed Fever, a well-known disease around 1840 that caused many women to die after giving birth, for the “*Dr. Semmelweis and the Discovery of Handwashing*” project provided by the DataCamp team. This project allows me to solve a real-world problem by applying my skills using tools like data notebooks and completing a data analysis from start to finish.

Skills and tools used during the project:
1. R Programming
2. Data Visualization (Line Chart)
3. Statistical Analysis (calculate t-test)
